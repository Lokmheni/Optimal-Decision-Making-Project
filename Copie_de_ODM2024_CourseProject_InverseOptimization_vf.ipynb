        "#MGT-483 Optimal Decision Making 2024: Group Project\n",
        "In traditional linear programming (LP), the goal is to find an optimal solution of a given optimization model with known input parameters. Inverse optimization (IO), on the other hand, seeks an optimization model that explains a given optimal decision, thereby reversing the conventional optimization process. IO has applications in various fields such as economics, engineering, and operations research and thus plays an important role in decision-making processes. For example, if past decisions of an economic agent are observable, IO allows us to learn this agent's decision model. This model may then allow us to predict future decisions of the agent, which could impact our own decision problem. Therefore, understanding and advancing IO techniques may help us to improve decision-making processes across diverse application domains.\n",

        "As a concrete example, consider the following situation. You are the manager of a manufacturing company entering a new market. The company aims to manufacture various products using a numer of raw materials. Your job is to negotiate the prices of these raw materials with the supplier. For this negotiation it would be helpful to know the prices that the supplier has offered to your competitor. Needless to say that your competitor has no interest in helping you by revealing this information. However, you may be able to estimate the prices offered to your competitor by using inverse optimization. To this end, assume that you know the production process used by your competitor. Assume also that you know the maximum amounts of the raw materials that can be ordered from the supplier over one planning cycle. This information allows you to construct the feasible set of the competitor's optimization problem (which is a manufacturing problem, that is, a linear program). Unfortunately, you do not know the competitor's objective function because it depends on the unknown prices for the raw materials. Fortunately, however, public companies are legally required to publish sales data, that is, you can observe your competitor's optimal production decisions. As we will see in this project, observing the optimal solution of a linear program with an unknown objective function allows us to construct an estimator for the objective function coefficients. Using this estimator, you can then (approximately) reconstruct the prices your competitor had to pay to the supplier for the raw materials. Now you are well prepared to enter negotiations with the supplier!\n",

The objective also contains an absolute value, therefore the objective is not linear neither.\n",

        "We now come back to the motivating example of a manager who has to negotiate the prices for raw materials with the supplier. You know that your competitor uses the same raw materials M1, M2 and M3 for producing four products P1, P2, P3 and P4. Assume that you know the production process used by your competitor, that is, you know a matrix $\\mathbf A\\in\\mathbb R^{3\\times 4}$, where $\\mathbf A_{ij}$ denotes the number of units of raw material Mi that are needed to prodce one unit of product Pj. Assume also that you know the vector $\\mathbf b\\in\\mathbb R^3$ of maximum amounts of the raw materials that can be ordered from the supplier over one planning cycle. Hence, the feasible set of the competitor's optimization problem is given by $\\{\\mathbf x\\in\\mathbb R^3_+:\\mathbf A\\mathbf x\\leq \\mathbf b\\}$. You also know the vector of prices $\\mathbf p\\in\\mathbb R^4$, at which the competitor sells the products. But we have only limited information about the vector $\\mathbf q\\in\\mathbb R^3$ of prices at which the competitor bought the raw materials from the supplier. More precisely, we know that $\\mathbf q_3=10$, but we do not know $\\mathbf q_1$ and $\\mathbf q_2$. Overall, you thus know that the competitor's objective is to maximize $\\mathbf p^\\top\\mathbf x - \\mathbf q^\\top \\mathbf A\\mathbf x$. Finally, you observe the competitor's production quantities $\\mathbf x^0\\in\\mathbb R^4$, because sales data is public knowlege. The following tables contain the entries of the matrix $\\mathbf A$ and the vectors $\\mathbf b$, $\\mathbf p$ and $\\mathbf x^0$.\n",
